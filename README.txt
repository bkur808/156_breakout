Hey
If you want to run w/ current setup -> Clone repository into a directory
In a terminal, navigate to /backend and run command > node index.js
In another terminal (at the same time - while backend server is running) navigate to /frontend/src and run command > npm start

In a browser you can now navigate to http://localhost:3000 and and play around.
(node index.js) gets the backend running, and (npm start) gets the frontend running.
